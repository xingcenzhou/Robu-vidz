Uses PostgreSQL to investigate and recommend the launch strategy for a fictional online video service.

# Background
The fictional company RockBuster Stealth LLC wants to launch an online video rental service among the stiff competition of video streaming services.
The project dives into the company's database, aiming to gain a better understanding of the film inventory, markets, sales and customer distribution, for a targeted focus on the online video rental platform.

# Tools and goals
The project uses PostgreSQL, PgAdmin and Tableau Public, with the goal of answering the following business questions:

1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# Result
This repo includes two example SQL queries that were used to answer some of the business questions.
